## Requirements

To use this template, your computer needs:

- Node.js is used to run the build processes. https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Run `node -v` in the terminal
- npm (Node comes with npm installed so you should have a version of npm.) Used to manage development dependencies.
- Run `npm -v`  in the terminal
- Gulp â€“ task runner `npm install -g gulp`
- Run `gulp -v` in the terminal

## Installation
- Install all node packages: `npm install`
- `npm run dev` to run build and start local server with files watcher
- Your site is now viewable at this URL: http://localhost:3000
- To create compressed, production-ready assets run `npm run build`. This will delete everything in the dist folder and recreate all of your complied files. Never make updates directly into the dist folder as these files get overridden each time.
