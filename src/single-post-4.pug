						p.h4 What?

						p During a course in tangible interfaces at Malm√∂ University we were tasked to design a tangible interface, the target group: children. Both me and my two peers set out to discover and define in what way children in the age of 4-6 were introduced to programming. A new skill that is now on the corriculums of the schools in Sweden.

						p.h4 How?

						p We started by exploring the swedish schoolsystem and the different ways programming are taught to children. By booking an interview with a preschool teacher specialised in programming and technique taught to children we learned alot. After the interview we were shadowing a group of preschool children at the age of 3-6 to learn how these children were using the different programming tools. Most of the tools were used in a playful matter, programming different toys to move or behave in different manners. From our findings we created an interactive playboard which was programable through different points on a screen. The programming resulted in different animations for different sea creatures on a screen. The interactive board was user tested by 8 children in the ages of 3-5 and the user tests were analysed.


						p.h4 Results?

						p.m-0 The narrative of the sea creatures could be altered depending on which of the points were activated, thus programming the sea creatures animations and movements. This was understood by most children after some time playing with the interactive playboard. What was not accounted for by us designers was the short attention span which children have. Something which need to be thought of and designed for in a future iteration.
