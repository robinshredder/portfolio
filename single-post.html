                    <p class="h4">What?</p>
                    <p>During a visit to Bagmans physical shop close to Hansa in Malmo. Me and the owner started talking in regard to their newly made webpage in wordpress. The owner was rather displeased with part of the webpage and was wondering why there where no orders coming from the webshop.</p>
                    <p class="h4">How?</p>
                    <p>To get suited for the mission I started exploring different similiar webshops. I was analysing the design choices, the user flow and the responsivity. In the second stage of said mission, 6 users were introduced to teh webpage with the goal of buying 2 bags. During the user tests the methods observation and think-out-load were used. Thanks to the user test I could identify issues the users had during their experience using the webshop. I could also point to a handful of bugs that I discovered during my exploration of the webpage.</p>
                    <p class="h4">Results?</p>
                    <p class="m-0">The users had expressed a feeling of distrust and confusion when using the webpage - because of bugs, hard to navigate user flows and a tough cashiers exit. As Bagman already had started to create a new webshop with the help of shopify, the best I could deliver was a written analysis of the discoveries during the discovery phase, a user flow chart and some visual design changes pointing to some of the issues users had. I.e. button size, text size, image sizes, navigational issues etc.</p>
